## Assignments

### Assignment 1: Directory Space Usage Calculation
In this assignment, I leveraged multi-processing utilities to recursively calculate directory space usage. The implementation allows users to efficiently assess the size of directories and their contents.

#### Features
- Recursive calculation of directory space usage.
- Utilizes multi-processing for performance optimization.

#### Assignment 2: System Call and Function Call Tracing in gemOS
This assignment involves integrating system call and function call tracing capabilities in gemOS, providing functionalities analogous to ftrace and strace in Linux. This enhancement enables detailed program execution analysis.
